Description
--------------

I have made the preprocessing of the images with the opencv framework and numpy arrays, normalizing some parameters and saving as pickle data. For the model I've built a Multilayer Perceptron with Keras and then used it to predict the test data. With the predictions I've rotated the images using the PIL package. Finally I've generated a numpy array with the rotated images and saved as pickle file.
